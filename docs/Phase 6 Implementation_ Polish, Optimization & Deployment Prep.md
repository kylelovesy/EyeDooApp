### 6.1 Remaining Questionnaire Sections (Photography Plan)

Complete the final questionnaire section, "Photography Plan", to capture detailed preferences and requirements for the photography session.

**File: `src/types/questionnaire.ts` (Additions)**

```typescript
// Photography Plan Schema
export const PhotographyPlanSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().optional(),
  stylePreferences: z.string().optional(),
  mustHaveShots: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  doNotShoot: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  groupPhotos: z.string().optional(),
  // Add more fields as needed
});

export type PhotographyPlan = z.infer<typeof PhotographyPlanSchema>;

// Update Main Questionnaire Schema (Additions)
export const QuestionnaireSchema = z.object({
  projectId: z.string(),
  essentialInfo: EssentialInfoSchema.optional(),
  timeline: z.array(TimelineEventSchema).optional(),
  keyPeople: z.array(KeyPersonSchema).optional(),
  photographyPlan: PhotographyPlanSchema.optional(),
});

// Ensure the Questionnaire type is re-exported with the new fields
export type Questionnaire = z.infer<typeof QuestionnaireSchema>;
```

**File: `src/services/questionnaireService.ts` (Additions)**

```typescript
// Add to QuestionnaireService class

### 6.2 UI/UX Improvements

Focus on enhancing the overall user experience and visual appeal of the application.

*   **Consistent Theming:** Ensure all new components and screens adhere to the defined `theme.ts` and `typography.ts`.
*   **Responsive Design:** Verify that all screens and components adapt well to different screen sizes and orientations.
*   **Loading Indicators:** Implement clear loading states for data fetching operations (e.g., using `ActivityIndicator` or custom loading components).
*   **Empty States:** Utilize the `EmptyState` component for lists or sections with no data.
*   **Form Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear feedback for form validations and submissions.
*   **Animations:** Consider subtle animations for transitions or interactions to improve perceived performance and user delight.

### 6.3 Performance Optimization

Implement strategies to improve the application's performance.

*   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` for functional components and `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive computations or callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   **FlatList Optimization:** For long lists, ensure `FlatList` is properly optimized with `keyExtractor`, `getItemLayout`, and `removeClippedSubviews`.
*   **Image Optimization:** Optimize image loading and display (e.g., lazy loading, appropriate image formats and sizes).
*   **Bundle Size Reduction:** Analyze and reduce the application's bundle size by removing unused dependencies and optimizing imports.

### 6.4 Error Handling and Accessibility

Strengthen the application's robustness and inclusivity.

*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Enhance `errorHandler.ts` to provide more comprehensive error logging and user-friendly error messages. Consider integrating with an error monitoring service.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint`.
    *   Verify proper navigation with screen readers.
    *   Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements.
    *   Provide keyboard navigation support where applicable.

### 6.5 Security Measures

Review and implement security best practices.

*   **Firestore Security Rules:** Develop and deploy robust Firestore security rules to protect user data and ensure only authorized users can access and modify their own project data.
*   **API Key Management:** Ensure API keys (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) are stored securely and not exposed in client-side code (e.g., using environment variables or Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side calls).
*   **Input Validation:** Reinforce server-side input validation in addition to client-side validation.

### 6.6 Testing and Verification

Conduct thorough testing across all new features and improvements.

**Unit Tests:**

*   **`src/services/questionnaireService.ts`:**
    *   Test `savePhotographyPlan` and `getPhotographyPlan`.

**Component Tests:**

*   **`app/(questionnaire)/photography-plan.tsx`:**
    *   Verify form rendering, input handling, and submission.
    *   Test validation for various fields.

**Integration Tests:**

*   Verify the complete flow for the Photography Plan: navigate, fill out, save, and confirm persistence.
*   Test end-to-end user flows, including authentication, project creation, and questionnaire completion.

**Performance Testing:**

*   Use Expo's built-in performance monitoring tools or third-party solutions to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

**Accessibility Testing:**

*   Use accessibility testing tools (e.g., Lighthouse for web, Android Accessibility Scanner, iOS Accessibility Inspector) to identify and fix accessibility issues.

**Security Audit:**

*   Review Firestore security rules and API key handling.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Run the application and navigate to a project's questionnaire section.
2.  Click the "Photography Plan" button.
3.  Fill in all fields with valid data and click "Save Photography Plan".
4.  Verify that the plan is saved and re-populates correctly upon re-opening.
5.  Thoroughly test all UI/UX improvements, ensuring responsiveness, proper loading states, and form feedback.
6.  Verify that error handling is robust and user-friendly.
7.  Confirm that all accessibility features are working as expected.
8.  Review Firebase console to ensure security rules are correctly applied and data access is restricted.

*   **App Store Submission:** Prepare all necessary assets (screenshots, app icons, descriptions) and metadata for submission to Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
*   **Firebase Deployment:** Deploy Firestore security rules and any Firebase Cloud Functions.

### 7.3 Monitoring and Analytics

Set up monitoring and analytics to track application performance and user engagement post-deployment.

*   **Firebase Performance Monitoring:** Integrate Firebase Performance Monitoring to track app startup times, network requests, and other performance metrics.
*   **Firebase Crashlytics:** Set up Firebase Crashlytics for real-time crash reporting and analysis.
*   **Google Analytics (or similar):** Integrate analytics to understand user behavior, feature usage, and engagement patterns.

### 7.4 Documentation and Handover

Prepare comprehensive documentation for future maintenance and development.

*   **Technical Documentation:** Document the application architecture, key components, services, and data models.
*   **Deployment Guide:** Provide clear instructions for building, deploying, and managing the application.
*   **Troubleshooting Guide:** Document common issues and their resolutions.
*   **User Manual (Optional):** Create a user-friendly guide for end-users.

### 7.5 Final Testing and Verification

Perform final tests on the deployed application.

**End-to-End Testing:**

*   Test the deployed application on various devices and network conditions.
*   Verify all features work correctly in the production environment.

**Regression Testing:**

*   Ensure that new changes have not introduced any regressions in existing functionality.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Verify that the Android and iOS builds are successful and can be installed on devices.
2.  Verify that the web build is accessible and fully functional in a web browser.
3.  Confirm that all Firebase services (Auth, Firestore) are correctly configured and accessible in the deployed environment.
4.  Check Firebase Performance Monitoring and Crashlytics dashboards for initial data.
5.  Review analytics data to ensure events are being tracked correctly.
6.  Confirm that all documentation is complete and accessible.

This concludes the comprehensive implementation guide for the EyeDooApp. Each phase builds upon the previous one, leading to a robust, performant, and user-friendly application. Good luck with your development!
